# Subbotnik
Subbotnik is a web app attempting to encourage people of Saint-Petersburg working all together with local authorities against trash on the city streets.
The main idea was to create an app which allows users to put their own placemarks of encountered dirty places on the city map so that others could see them too and join a chat room for that matter. If the area chat gets enough volunteers, they could ask a support from authorities and organize their own Subbotnik.
